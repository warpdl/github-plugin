# WarpDL Base Extension Template

This is a template for creating a new WarpDL extension. It includes a basic manifest.json file and a main.js file. The manifest.json file contains the general details of the extension and the main.js file contains the main logic of the extension as it acts as an entrypoint for our extension as declared in manifest. 

Pleas edit the manifest.json file and replace the predefined values with your own values like name, version, description etc.
